# note-cli

This is a small CLI that allows one to manage notes(typically in Markdown) using the commandline and nodejs

You can install this for yourself using 

```sh
npm install note-cli
```

or

```sh
npm install -g note-cli
```

for global install.

If you just want to use it one time, you can use

```sh
npx note-cli
```

Very much in the WIP stage at the moment, so I'll fill the rest of this in later.
